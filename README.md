## Christian Bator
Welcome to my little corner of the internet. The things that get me up in the morning are the mysteries of the mind, jazz piano, tennis on clay courts, and fruit.

**Brainwaves**  
My main interests are consciousness and computer perception, the former I believe to be the biggest scientific mystery facing humanity: why is there something that it's like to be you?

If we solve the hard problem of consciousness, can we create silicon minds that are not only more intelligent, but also more significant than our own – beings with extraordinary subjective experiences?

**Soundwaves**  
I grew up playing jazz drums and orchestral percussion, but lately I've been focusing more on piano. I'm into all sorts of things, but a short list probably looks like: Iiro Rantala, Chris Potter, Sufjan Stevens, James Blake, and Slavic Soul Party.
